## Lessons Learned

What did I learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

This was my second project using MySQL, and Sequelize greatly simplified the process. Having worked extensively with MongoDB, I found that Sequelizeâ€™s ORM approach allowed me to apply similar CRUD operations and query handling, easing the transition between databases.

Additionally, I used Clever Cloudâ€™s MySQL database for the first time. Setting up a free cloud-based database was straightforward and smooth, which made the integration seamless.

Challenges:  
1.Sequelize with MySQL: Although it was my first time using Sequelize with MySQL, its ORM features made the learning curve manageable and efficient.
2.Deployment Issues: Initially, I attempted to deploy the project on Vercel, but it didn't succeed. I then deployed it on Render.com, which worked smoothly.
